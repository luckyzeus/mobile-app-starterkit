# Roadmap

## Near-term
- Add a small **DevBadge** overlay (shows PATH/DATA/AUTH + uid) for debugging/testing.
- Update styling to be consistent across UI and reformat SignInScreen.tsx
- Create/Polish all proper documentation

## Medium-term
- A parallel **AWS** adapter example (Cognito + AppSync) & Redux example files to show swapability.
- Add more modular example functions for backend calls to cover most typical onboarding/auth/user functionality
- Add detailed further documentation and examples to current/recommended packages and libraries.
